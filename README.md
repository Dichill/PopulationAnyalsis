# Population Analysis
Using **Exponential Growth** we can **likely predict** the **population** from a **certain year**. This also **solves** the **Average Annual Growth Rate**.
I made this during my free time for our Math Project. I suck at math, however coding helps me to emphasize how to solve real life problems
much easier, and with it, it also helped me how to solve Math problems, and I hope it also helped you too.

```py
"""
    Example Data:
        Year  |   Population
        2015      131,528
        2020      148,012
"""

# From the code, simply change the code from the data that you have as shown below.

# What municipality were you conducting from?
municipality = "Consolacion" 

# Starting from the starting year 2015, we go upto 2032. Since in our Math Project 
# we had to predict the population ten years from now (2022 as of writing)
years = [2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030, 2031, 2032]

    ending_year = Ending Year of your population data
"""
p = 131528 # Change to your Starting Population (See above for example)
pt = 148012 # Change to you Ending Population (See above for example)
