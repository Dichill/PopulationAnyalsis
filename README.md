# Population Analysis
Using Exponential Growth we can likely predict the population from a certain year. This also solves the Average Annual Growth Rate.
I made this during my free time for our Math Project. I suck at math, however coding helps me emphasize how to solve real life problems
much easier, and with it, it also helped me how to solve Math Problems. I hope it also helps you too.

## Examples

```py
"""
    Year  |   Population
    2015      131,528
    2020      148,012
"""

# From the code, simply change the code from the data that you have as shown below.

"""
    p = Starting Population
    pt = Ending Population
    starting_year = Starting Year of your population data
    ending_year = Ending Year of your population data
"""
    p = 131528 # Change to your Starting Population (See above for example)
    pt = 148012 # Change to you Ending Population (See above for example)
    starting_year = 2015 # Starting Year from your starting Population
    ending_year = 2020 # Ending Year from your ending Population
